TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
While loops, f-strings, rejecting errors were all things I've learnt this week. F-strings I found to be a useful way of writing strings because the format is visually intuitive to interpret with what is happening. Combining these tools to create algorithms and just thinking about how to go about constructing algorithms was strongly exercised - coming up with a working script for the 'game' and the 'game solver' was challenging; I found it difficult to keep track of the order of functions and loops within loops.
