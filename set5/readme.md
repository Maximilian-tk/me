TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Learnt how to use refactoring in the context of past activities (word pyramid). This was fine to learn.
Using programming to draw shapes and seeing it run live to construct the 2D shape was interesting. Using logic to figure out how to construct shapes was refreshing because I could see the resemblance in use for these skills to computational design to parametric algorithms in Grasshopper
