Learned how to use conditions for variables and loop functions. Loops within loops r pretty funky, you can combine them with conditions to create algorithms (and a bit of maths) to form shapes with organised data.

The most difficult parts of learning is grasping the original concepts of functions - the logic side of creating the scripts where I had to figure out how to edit and adapt the functions was more manageable than the initial learning of what the functions actually do.
